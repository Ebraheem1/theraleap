\section{Problem description}
hand therapy from home, refer to previous works
\section{Requirement Analysis}
\section{Solution Design}
\subsection{Available Alternatives}
"dumb" web platform for visualizing, main work happening in server processes running locally

fully featured web platform, doing everything

GUI Application
\subsection{Elected Alternative}
fully featured web platform, because modern web technologies allow it, GUI Application does not fit the requirements, and separating main work into server thread is, while potentially more performant, both potentially insecure and unnecessarily complex.
\section{Project Scope}
framework for others to build upon. minimum viable product covering as much of the overall required architecture as possible.
