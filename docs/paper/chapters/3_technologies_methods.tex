\chapter{Technologies and Methods}
\label{sec:tech_and_methods}
This chapter gives a quick introduction to the non-trivial technologies and methods used while developing the system. For purposes of brevity, technologies that are well known or only marginally relevant to the following chapters have been ommited\footnote{Such as CSS3, HTML5, ES6, CSS Preprocessors, and GIT}. The utilized technologies can roughly be categorized into runtime specific technologies, which are relevant during system execution, and development technologies, which are only relevant while developing, compiling, and testing the system.
