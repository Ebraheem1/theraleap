Webpack 4

VueJS 2, Vue Router, VueX, inversify Dependency Injection

Karma Unit Tests

THREE.js
\section{Implemented Subsystems}
\subsection{Device Driver Interface}
Describe Generalized Device Driver Interface. Point out that adding different devices is possible with this architecture.
\subsection{Device Facade}
Justify for a need of a Facade in Front of the raw Device Driver: Seperation of Concerns and Recording (Mock data) Functionality. Ease of Testing.
\subsection{Device Debug Interface}
Describe Component: Raw Device Logger, Device Status Log, Device Graphical Log
\subsection{Graphical Hand Logger}
THREE.JS, OrbitControls, Smoothing, Prop Configuration
\subsection{Device Recorder}
Record Segments of hand movements in order to aid in development, make classification errors reproducible
\subsection{Persistence Provider}
Describe Abstract Persistence Provider Interface

Describe Concrete Persistence Provider Interface Implementation: IndexedDB
\subsection{Preprocessing Framework}
Justify need for Preprocessing: Lots of useless data coming from the device. Preliminary
clean up of data may be relevant for all classifiers
\subsection{Classification Framework}
Describe how Classifiers receive the preprocessed data frame stream, and transform the stream in order to emit another stream of classifications, along with relevant metadata
\subsection{Game Execution Engine}
Describe how Games are receiving the Classification Stream and using that in order to drive the gameplay.
